# EncodeClub Solidity Bootcamp - Week 4 Assignment
## Weekend Project

This is a group activity for at least 3 students:

* Complete the projects together with your group
* Create a voting dApp to cast votes, delegate and query results on chain
* Request voting tokens to be minted using the API
* (bonus) Store a list of recent votes in the backend and display that on frontend
* (bonus) Use an oracle to fetch off-chain data
  * Use an oracle to fetch information from a data source of your preference
  * Use the data fetched to create the proposals in the constructor of the ballot

### Voting dApp integration guidelines

* Single POST method:
  * Request voting tokens from API
* Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot
* All other interactions must be made directly on-chain <br>
